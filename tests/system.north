; linux system calls
;
; linux system calls are of the general form:
; arg5 arg4 arg3 arg2 arg1 arg0 syscall_number syscall
; these correspond to the arguments in arg0 (%rdi) arg1 (%rsi) arg2 (%rdx) arg3 (%r10) arg4 (%r8) arg5 (%r9)
; not all arguments are required for each syscall
; 
; fd, 0 = stdin, 1 = stdout, 2 = stderr
;
; syscall 0 (read)
; count *buf fd 0 syscall
; the ´syscall´ token consumes 4 args from the stack and the return code (number of bytes read for syscall 0) is pushed back to the stack
; remember read() doesn't add '\0' to terminate to make it string (just gives raw buffer).

; syscall 1 (write)
; count *buf fd 1 syscall
; the ´syscall´ token consumes 4 args from the stack and the return code (number of bytes written for syscall 1) is pushed back to the stack

; syscall 231 (exit_group)
; exitcode 231 syscall
; the ´syscall´ token consumes 2 args from the stack, exits the program with ´exitcode´, does not return

; syscall 2 (open)
; mode flags *filename 2 syscall
; the ´syscall´ token consumes 4 args from the stack and the return (fd for file) is pushed back to the stack

; syscall 3 (close)
; fd 3 syscall
; the ´syscall´ token consumes 2 args from the stack and the return (0 for success, -1 for error) is pushed back to the stack



; reading a byte from stdin
1 mem 0 0 syscall drop

; writing it to stdout
1 mem 1 1 syscall drop

; or more simply:
"Hello World!\n" 1 1 syscall drop

; exit with exit code 0
;0 231 syscall

; or more simply:
;0 exit
